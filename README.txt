The software's usage is thoroughly written in the report.
Please see "report.pdf" in this directory.

For the executables, it is compiled on OSX Yosemite 10.10.5.
To obtain a workable version on other OS, please download OpenCV and Cmake.
(OpenCV depends on Cmake, so both has to be installed)

OpenCV: http://opencv.org/downloads.html
Cmake: https://cmake.org/download/

After successfully downloading both of them,
please follow the instruction in the report to obtain the executables.
(which is actually as simple as typing "cmake .; make" in this directory)
